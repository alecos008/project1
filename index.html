                Rapper Eminem's newest music video for his song "Higher" from his new album "Music to be Murdered
                By--Side B" had his fans thinking he was getting into a martial arts competition.

                A clip from the video appeared during the ESPN pre-show on Friday for Conor McGregor and Dustin
                Poirier's Saturday night match in Abu Dhabi. The segment featured a mock interview between ESPN
                anchor Michael Eaves and UFC boss Dana White discussing the rapper's chances in a fictional fight.
                Eminem entered the interview towards the end and told White that "The best part about your opinion
                is that it doesn't matter."
